13 Other supplier relationships and components may be multi-sourced and easily replaced, such as the controller functions or component suppliers providing MOSFET power transistors. TSMC is the world’s largest foundry and captures greater than 50% of the world’s market share. At the advanced nodes, we believe they unequivocally lead the charge and consistently outperform industry averages. Bitmain, for instance, uses TSMC’s 12, 16, and 28 nm process nodes and has announced its transition to 7nm for their next nodes.

14 Theoretically, a miner manufacturer could become dissatisfied over time and engage with another foundry for future nodes, but we believe even that is unlikely. Engagements with foundry partners are likely to last at least a few years, with engagement on a single node basis lasting 12 - 18 months.

19 Bitmain becoming the leading miner manufacturer from 2013-2017 and struggling thereafter exemplifies the importance of the ASIC design
team to a manufacturer’s success. Bitmain’s dominance evolved in large part due to the quality of the Antminer S7 and S9 machines. The performance of the S9, driven by its efficient design, allowed Bitmain to rapidly gain market share and become the largest manufacturer. Three years after release, the S9 is still one of the most popular Bitcoin miners until very recently. Upon designing the S9, Yang Zuoxing,
a former director responsible for the Antminer designs, left Bitmain to start a competing manufacturer - Bitewei. With Yang at the helm, Bitewei released the Whatsminer M10, a mining rig considerably more efficient than the S9. During this same time, Bitmain was rumored to have struggled with its 10nm and 7nm designs, in part due to the departure of Yang.

22 This process is known as “scan testing” and uses a pre-determined suite of signals that tests each gate on the chip. The tested wafers are
sewn into individual dies.

23 This consists of custom packaging for the die. The packaging team must optimize for signal integrity, thermal efficiency, reliability, and cost.
This step is highly customizable and a potential point of differentiation across firms. For example, early Bitmain machines were known for their superior thermal design. It is common for firms to outsource certain parts of the packaging and testing process - though they vary in how much they do in-house vs outsourced. For example, Canaan relies on a number of production partners, including ChipPAC, SPIL, and STATS ChipPAC for IC packaging and testing.

41 The HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in the market and then summing the resulting numbers. For example, for a market consisting of four firms with shares of 30, 30, 20, and 20 percent, the HHI is 2,600 (302 + 302 + 202 + 202 = 2,600)

44 The Stratum Protocol is the current standard adopted by mining pool operators. As explained by core developer Matt Corallo, “the design of the Stratum protocol requires pool operators to build and distribute block templates to their clients. Without a diverse body of miners constructing block templates, the network’s censorship resistance is jeopardized (e.g. pool operators may use their position of power to restrict the flow of protocol upgrades).”In March of 2018, Matt Corallo released the BetterHash Mining Protocol. With the Stratum protocol, miners can actually «steal» hashpower from the pool operator by pretending to be that operator. BetterHash has a far more effective authentication mechanism. In BetterHash, block construction and payouts would be divided into two protocols, Work and Pool. Instead of mining pool operators, individual miners would have discretion over which transactions to include in the blocks, while still benefiting from a stable payout. By controlling block templates, individual miners are no longer exposed to the risk of mining pools censoring transactions.
